TODO for debian cm-super package:
---------------------------------
* Variants of sharp-s ÃŸ are present, how to make them available?
  There is a comment in README.Debian, but can we do something better?
* Do *not* recreate the pfb fonts und upgrade, only on new install!
  (carefull on major version changes!)
* check whether dependencies are correct for texlive on tfm/mf files, and
  should we recommend / suggest texlive-langcyrillic?
* go back to /etc/X11/fonts/Type1 instead of /etc/X11/fonts/X11R7/Type1
  I hate this, now I have to care for conf file changes and updates ....
  could debhelper maintainers think about this before sending bug reports
  and bugging other maintainers...
